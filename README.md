# drawing_with_turtles
A turtle powered drawing program!

This is just a simple program using Python's built-in turtle module and Tkinter. 
It has GUI controls to make a turtle draw lines, shapes, and patterns, as well as adjust color and speed.
Before it got a bit out of hand, the project originally stemmed from the book "Math Adventures With Python" by Peter Ferrell.
